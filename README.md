Program that finds the shortest path a knight chess piece can take from one square to another. 
For example, if the knight started at position (5,2) (scale starts from zero) and wanted to get
to (3,6) the program will find [5,2] => [4,4] => [3,6] as the shortest route. Since a knight
can get from one square to any other square given enough moves, any two coordinates can be
entered.
